# Front-end architecture

## Tooling

### Technologies

- Development runtime environment: [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- Package manager: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- Bundler: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Framework: [React](https://react.dev/)
- UI library: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)

### Main scripts

- `pnpm install` - install the dependencies, updating the lockfile as needed (except when the `CI` env var is defined)
- `pnpm start` - start the development server at <http://localhost:5173>
- `pnpm build` - build the front-end for production into the `ui/build` folder
- `pnpm preview` - serve the production build at <http://localhost:5173>

### Code quality

The codebase is formatted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), linted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and tested with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/):

- `pnpm prettier` - check formatting
- `pnpm format` - fix formatting
- `pnpm eslint` - check for linting errors
- `pnpm fix` - fix linting errors
- `pnpm cypress` - open Cypress testing UI
- `pnpm e2e` - run Cypress E2E tests

> Most editors support fixing and formatting files automatically on save. The configuration for VSCode is provided out of the box, so all you need to do is install the recommended extensions.

### pnpm cheatsheet

- `pnpm add [--save-dev] <pkg-name>` - [add a dependency](https://pnpm.io/cli/add)
- `pnpm why <pkg-name>` - show why a package is present in `node_modules`
- `pnpm up -L <pkg-name>` - update a package to the latest version
- `pnpm outdated` - list outdated dependencies
- `pnpm [run] <script> [--<arg>]` - run a script defined in `package.json`
- `pnpm dlx <pkg-name>` - fetch a package from the registry and run its default
  command binary (equivalent to `npx <pkg-name>`)

> You can run all `pnpm` commands from the root of the repository with `pnpm --prefix ui <cmd>`.

## Guidelines

### React

While you'll still see a lot of class-based components in the codebase, please strive to use [function components](https://react.dev/learn#components) when implementing new features or refactoring existing code.

### State management

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is used to manage the app's global state and [React Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) to subscribe React components to changes in the store.

The [Redux Style Guide](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/) contains some good advice on managing state with Redux. In particular:

- Be sure to not store state in Redux if it doesn't need to be globally available to all components. Prefer local React state (i.e. `useState`) and URL state instead, and prefer managing/retrieving state higher up the component hierarchy if it needs to be passed down to multiple components.
- Do not store duplicated state, or state that can be computed from other state. Prefer creating your own custom React hooks instead (with `useSelector` + computation).

Additionally, please strive to connect to the Redux store using the React Redux [hooks API](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks) rather than the old `connect` API. Note that this may require converting class-based components to function components.

To debug state management issues, you can either install the [Redux devtools extension](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/tree/main/extension#installation) or turn on [Redux logger](https://github.com/LogRocket/redux-logger) with the corresponding [environment variable](#environment-variables).

### Fetching layer

- For each back-end API called by the front-end, there is a file under `src/api/` named after that API (e.g. `beamline.js`, `login.js` ...)
- For each endpoint, there is a function in the API's front-end file dedicated to making HTTP requests to that endpoint (e.g. `fetchLoginInfo`, `fetchBeamInfo` ...)
  - Functions that retrieve resources are named `fetch<Something>`.
  - Functions that perform actions are named `send<DoSomething>`.
- The [wretch](https://github.com/elbywan/wretch) library is used to make HTTP requests; it is a thin wrapper around the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

### Styling

A significant amount of styling is provided by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). If you need to override these styles or write custom styles from scratch for a component, please use [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).

Global styles should be avoided at all cost as they can conflict with one another and with Bootstrap's styles. They are also more difficult to maintain in the long run.

### Environment variables

Environment variables are defined in file `ui/.env`. To override them, create your own local environment file as explained in the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-files) â€“ e.g. `ui/.env.local` or `ui/.env.production.local`.

The following environment variables are available:

- `VITE_REDUX_LOGGER_ENABLED`: whether to log Redux actions to the browser console (disabled by default); useful if you're unable to install the [Redux devtools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/tree/main/extension#installation) browser extension.
- `VITE_BG_COLOR`: background color for the `body` tag. Useful for making a distinction between various deployment environments.

### Linting

MXCuBE-Web uses the [ESRF's shared linting configuration](https://gitlab.esrf.fr/ui/eslint-config), which includes many ESLint plugins (`unicorn`, `regexp`, `import`, etc.) and is fully compatible with Prettier.

The config is fairly strict by default but fully customisable thanks to ESLint's [flat config format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files). If you strongly disagree with a rule or if a rule is not worth fixing anywhere in the codebase, either disable it entirely or configure it as you see fit in `ui/eslint.config.js`. Make sure to explain why in a comment:

```js
const config = defineConfig([
  // ...
  {
    rules: {
      "react/prop-types": "off", // legacy code, not worth fixing

      /* Default is "avoid", but there are lots of complicated `switch` statements,
       * notably in Redux reducers, which benefit from clear case blocks. */
      "unicorn/switch-case-braces": ["warn", "always"],
    },
  },
  {
    /* Some rules apply only to specific files. Make sure to use the same `files`
     * array as in `@esrf/eslint-config` (unless you're just turning the rule off). */
    files: ["**/*.{jsx,tsx}"],
    rules: {
      "jsx-a11y/control-has-associated-label": ["error"], // report as errors instead of warnings
    },
  },
]);
```

If you turn off a rule completely, beware that it will not be applied to new code. To disable a rule on existing code only, use [`eslint-disable` directives](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/rules#disabling-rules) instead (assuming the number of violations is within reason):

```js
/* eslint-disable react/prop-types --
 * Long explanation why the rule is disabled in the whole file. */

// eslint-disable-next-line react/no-multi-comp -- next-line syntax with short explanation
export function MyComponent(props) {
  let foo; // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars -- same-line syntax

  return (
    {/* eslint-disable-next-line jsx-a11y/anchor-is-valid -- JSX syntax */}
    <a onClick={(e) => e.stopPropagation()}>{props.value}</a>
  );
}
```

If you think the shared config should be changed, if you'd like to better understand the rationale behind some of the rules and options, or if you're unsure how to fix a specific violation, please open an issue in the [shared config's repo](https://gitlab.esrf.fr/ui/eslint-config).
